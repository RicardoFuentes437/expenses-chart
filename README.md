## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass
- Chart.js
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

For this challenge i worked with Chart.js which is a JavaScript Library that helps you create charts for your page, i've never worked with it before but it was really interesting and fun, i learned how to create a bar chart and customize it.

### Continued development

i would like to continue working with Chart.js since i only got to create on type of chart but there's a lot of other types like bubble chart, doughnut and pie charts, radar charts, among others, it would be interesting to implement them too and learn how to customize them.

### Useful resources

- [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/) - The official Chart.js documentation, it helped me to create and customize the bar char for this challenge.
